Write a program to load ALP program from input file to main memory.
#!/bin/bash
# Simulated main memory file
MEMORY_FILE="main_memory.txt"
# Input ALP file
read -p "Enter the ALP input file name: " input_file
# Check if the input ALP file exists
if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
    echo "Input file does not exist."
    exit 1
fi
# Clear the memory file before loading new content
> "$MEMORY_FILE"
# Load ALP into simulated main memory
echo "Loading ALP program into main memory..."
line_number=1
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Loading line $line_number: $line"
    echo "$line" >> "$MEMORY_FILE"
    ((line_number++))
done < "$input_file"
echo "ALP program loaded into main memory (stored in $MEMORY_FILE)."
